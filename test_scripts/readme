These scripts are useful for testing the multithreading capabilities of my
program. They only work if you move them up a directory, though, and test2.sh
only tries to download files named "macbeth(number).txt" - I did it to test
high-volume parallel downloads, and it worked well for me. I removed those
files from the www directory because they were huge, but kept test2.sh to show
some insight as to how I tested the program.

Also, sometimes these scripts will hang. Probably something to do with the fact
that everything happens in the background, but I'm not sure. Either way, they
might be helpful to you if you want to try them out; what's important is that
it's due to either the implementation of wget or my scripts, not the server.
