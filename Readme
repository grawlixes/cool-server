This is a simple HTTP server that can handle several clients at once using
multiple threads. These threads enable you to download several files
concurrently with minimal performance loss.

To run the server, just type "make." You have to close it with ctrl C
when you're done.

My implementation is pretty simple. I have a main function that executes
automatically, and it sets up the server by binding to a random available
port and listening for available connections. Whenever a new client makes
contact with the server, its request is handled by a thread calling the
"process" function after accepting. If the requested resource is in the www
directory, a HTTP response is built, the access map is updated (with proper
locking), the requested output is given, and the content is delivered. If
it isn't, then a 404 is returned. Either way, the repsonse is sent and
the client's connection is closed after, exiting the thread at the end
of the function.

For examples, please see my test scripts.
